Python leaning high level concenpts understanding and review

1 - Data analysis with libraries (Pandas, Seaborn/Maplotlib)
- Pandas is an open-source library commonly used in data science. 
It is primarily used for data analysis, data manipulation, and data cleaning. 
Pandas allow for simple data modeling and data analysis operations without needing to write a lot of code.

- Matplotlib is an extensive library for creating fixed, interactive, and animated Python visualizations.

- Seaborn is another popular Matplotlib-based Python data visualization framework, Seaborn is a high-level interface for creating aesthetically appealing and valuable statistical visuals which are crucial for studying and comprehending data.  

2 - Functions - Python Functions is a block of statements that return the specific task.
The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function 
so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, 
we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again.
e.g.- 
def my_function(*kids):
print("The youngest child is " + kids[2])

my_function("Emil", "Tobias", "Linus")

-Unique - The unique() function from Numpy is used to find the unique elements of an array.

- Set - The set() function creates a set object. The items in a set list are unordered, so it will appear in random order

- Union - The union() method returns a set that contains all items from the original set, and all items from the specified set(s).
We can specify as many sets you want, separated by commas. It does not have to be a set, it can be any iterable object.

- Groupby - A groupby() function is used to split the data into groups based on some criteria.

- lambda - A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

- Pivot - The pivot() function is used to reshaped a given DataFrame organized by given index / column values.

- unpivot - In pandas, we can use the melt() function to unpivot a DataFrame â€“ converting it from a wide format to a long format
